Understanding the Link Between Housing and Substance Use 

* Empirical research project with the Inner City Health and Wellness Program (ICHWP)  investigating the relationship between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and substance use among People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) in Edmontonâ€™s inner city, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and housing crisis.

The goals for this project were 
1.) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which substance use is linked with specific social factors using the Social Determinants of Health Framework 

2.) to assess the extent of these relationships to substance use patterns in light of the ongoing drug poisoning crisis. 

3.) Regression analysis was used to look at the association between different dimensions of housing and severity of unregulated substance use 

4.) Predictive modelling of future risk of overdose based on DUDIT scores and survey responses
